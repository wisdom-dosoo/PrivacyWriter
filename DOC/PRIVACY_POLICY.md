**Effective Date:** December 7, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Introduction

PrivacyWriter ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data.

**The short version:** We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data. All AI processing happens locally on your device.

## 2. Data Collection & Processing

### 2.1 Local Processing (On-Device)
PrivacyWriter uses Google Chrome's built-in AI models (Gemini Nano) to process text.
*   **Input Text:** When you use features like Grammar Check, Rewrite, Summarize, or Translate, the text is processed entirely within your browser instance.
*   **No Data Egress:** Your text is **never** sent to our servers or any third-party cloud servers for AI processing.

### 2.2 User Data
*   **We do not collect** personal identification information (PII).
*   **We do not collect** browsing history.
*   **We do not use** cookies or tracking pixels.

### 2.3 Local Storage
The extension uses your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to save:
*   User preferences (e.g., dark mode settings).
*   Usage counters (e.g., daily request count).
*   This data stays on your device and is removed if you uninstall the extension.

## 3. Permissions

We request the minimum permissions necessary for the extension to function:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | To analyze text on the current page when you trigger the extension. |
| `scripting` | To show the floating toolbar and replace text on web pages. |
| `storage` | To save your settings locally. |
| `sidePanel` | To display the persistent writing assistant panel. |

## 4. Third-Party Services

*   **Google Chrome:** The extension relies on the Chrome browser's built-in AI capabilities. Chrome's handling of local AI models is subject to Google's privacy policy.
*   **Chrome Web Store:** If you install via the Chrome Web Store, Google collects basic install statistics (aggregate data), which we can view to monitor extension performance. We do not see individual user data.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.
